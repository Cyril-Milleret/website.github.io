I am a quantitative ecologist. I especially like to apply statistical methods to make sense of data. 
At the moment, I am working halftime at the university of Norwegian life sciences ([NMBU](https://www.nmbu.no/en), Norway) and halftime at the [CEFE-CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) at Montpellier (France)
where I am part of the [AEQG](https://www.nmbu.no/en/research/groups/applied-quantitative-ecology-group-aqeg) and [HAIR](https://human-animal-interactions.github.io/) group.
My work consists mostly in developing and applying statistical methods to estimate the demography and population size of wildlife populations.

I especially worked on the development of spatial-capture recapture models.
These methods are now used to monitor wolf populations in France and in Scandinavia, as well as wolverines and bears in Scandinavia.
